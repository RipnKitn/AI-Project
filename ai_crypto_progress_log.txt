Progress Log - AI Crypto Project

Session Overview:
- 35 versions of main.py created over 8 days and 100+ sessions.
- Last session ended with a setback, requiring us to restart and attempt recovery.
- Previous work was overwritten due to an issue with code provided.
- Goal: Keep track of all progress, including coding versions and workflow, for future sessions.

Key Actions in Recent Session:
1. Flask app was successfully set up and running on localhost (127.0.0.1:80).
2. Webhook endpoint (`/webhook`) created in `main.py`.
3. Adjustments made to TradingView alert for testing with a $1 trade amount.
4. Progress lost during session transition, which caused wasted time and effort.

Important Notes for Future Sessions:
- **Use minimal trade amounts** ($1) for testing to avoid hitting Coinbase's minimum trade limits.
- **Webhook functionality**: Ensure TradingView alerts send correctly to `http://127.0.0.1:80/webhook`.
- Flask app should be run with `python main.py` on port 80 to listen for webhooks.

Steps Moving Forward:
1. Continue testing webhook functionality with TradingView alerts.
2. Track any issues in the system (e.g., code not working as expected, API issues).
3. Regularly save progress and log any critical changes or updates to the system.

Known Issues:
- Some previous code may have been overwritten by mistake, causing issues in the current setup.
- Need a better way to track each session's progress to avoid setbacks.
